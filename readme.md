#WebGL Bootstrap featuring TWGL.js and VITE

This is a simple bootstrap code for creating Fragment Shaders with openGL
in a simple and small HTML/JS bootstrap package. It's a very small start 
but has room to grow and expand unpon.

Included is a simple 'Mouse' class that is used to send in the mouse position
into the shaders uniforms.

Todos:

- texture loading
- asset mangement
- buffer shaders
